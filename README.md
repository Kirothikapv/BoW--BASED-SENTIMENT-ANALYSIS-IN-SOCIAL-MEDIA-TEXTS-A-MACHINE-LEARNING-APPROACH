This study focuses on utilizing the bag of words model for sentiment analysis, with the goal of interpreting the emotions and opinions expressed in the ChatGPT Twitter dateset. The extensive ChatGPT Twitter dateset offers a wealth of text, offering valuable glimpses into prevalent sentiments, public perspectives, and emerging trends. Analyzing these sentiments can provide valuable insights into societal trends, facilitating informed decision-making and a deeper understanding of public discourse dynamics. The study underscores the significance of employing fundamental NLP techniques for sentiment analysis within modern social media landscapes.
The main objective of this project is to apply a range of machine learning classifiers to the ChatGPT dateset, such as Logistic Regression, LSVM, and Naive Bayes. These algorithms have demonstrated notable accuracy levels, achieving 95%, and 94% respectively.
